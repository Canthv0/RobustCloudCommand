## SYNOPSIS
Generic wrapper script that tries to ensure that a script block successfully finishes execution in O365 against a large object count.

Works well with intense operations that may cause throttling

## DESCRIPTION
Wrapper script that tries to ensure that a script block successfully finishes execution in O365 against a large object count.

It accomplishes this by doing the following:
* Monitors the health of the Remote powershell session and restarts it as needed.
* Restarts the session every X number seconds to ensure a valid connection.
* Attempts to work past session related errors and will skip objects that it can't process.
* Attempts to calculate throttle exhaustion and sleep a sufficient time to allow throttle recovery

## PARAMETER AutomaticThrottle
Calculated value based on your tenants powershell recharge rate.
You tenant recharge rate can be calculated using a Micro Delay Warning message.

Look for the following line in your Micro Delay Warning Message
Balance: -1608289/2160000/-3000000 

The middle value is the recharge rate.
Divide this value by the number of milliseconds in an hour (3600000)
And subtract the result from 1 to get your AutomaticThrottle value

1 - (2160000 / 3600000) = 0.4

Default Value is .25

## PARAMETER IdentifyingProperty
What property of the objects we are processing that will be used to identify them in the log file and host
If the value is not set by the user the script will attempt to determine if one of the following properties is present
"DisplayName","Name","Identity","PrimarySMTPAddress","Alias","GUID"

If the value is not set and we are not able to match a well known property the script will generate an error and terminate.

## PARAMETER LogFile
Location and file name for the log file.

## PARAMETER ManualThrottle
Manual delay of X number of milliseconds to sleep between each cmdlets call.
Should only be used if the AutomaticThrottle isn't working to introduce sufficient delay to prevent Micro Delays

## PARAMETER NonInteractive
Suppresses output to the screen.  All output will still be in the log file.

## PARAMETER Recipients
Array of objects to operate on. This can be mailboxes or any other set of objects.
Input must be an array!
Anything coming in from the array can be accessed in the script block using $input.property

## PARAMETER ResetSeconds
How many seconds to run the script block before we rebuild the session with O365.

## PARAMETER ScriptBlock
The script that you want to robustly execute against the array of objects.  The Recipient objects will be provided to the cmdlets in the script block
and can be accessed with $input as if you were pipelining the object.

## OUTPUTS
Creates the log file specified in -logfile.  Log file contains a record of all actions taken by the script.

## EXAMPLE
invoke-command -scriptblock {Get-mailbox -resultsize unlimited | select-object -property Displayname,PrimarySMTPAddress,Identity} -session (get-pssession) | export-csv c:\temp\mbx.csv

$mbx = import-csv c:\temp\mbx.csv

$cred = get-Credential

.\Start-RobustCloudCommand.ps1 -Credential $cred -recipients $mbx -logfile C:\temp\out.log -ScriptBlock {Set-Clutter -identity $input.PrimarySMTPAddress.tostring() -enable:$false}

Gets all mailboxes from the service returning only Displayname,Identity, and PrimarySMTPAddress.  Exports the results to a CSV
Imports the CSV into a variable
Gets your O365 Credential
Executes the script setting clutter to off using Legacy Credentials

## EXAMPLE
invoke-command -scriptblock {Get-mailbox -resultsize unlimited | select-object -property Displayname,PrimarySMTPAddress,Identity} -session (get-pssession) | export-csv c:\temp\recipients.csv

$recipients = import-csv c:\temp\recipients.csv

Start-RobustCloudCommand -recipients $recipients -logfile C:\temp\out.log -ScriptBlock {Get-MobileDeviceStatistics -mailbox $input.PrimarySMTPAddress.tostring() | Select-Object -Property @{Name = "PrimarySMTPAddress";Expression={$input.PrimarySMTPAddress.tostring()}},DeviceType,LastSuccessSync,FirstSyncTime | Export-Csv c:\temp\stats.csv -Append }

Gets All Recipients and exports them to a CSV (for restart ability)
Imports the CSV into a variable
Executes the script to gather EAS Device statistics and output them to a csv file using ADAL with support for MFA
